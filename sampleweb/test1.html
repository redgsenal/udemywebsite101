    <em>What is HTML?</em>
    <p>
      <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
      content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
      such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and scripting languages such
      as <b>JavaScript</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web browsers receive <b>HTML</b> documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page <i>semantically</i> and originally included
      cues for its appearance.

    <p>
      <b>HTML</b> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
      constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
      embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
      &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
      Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide
      information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
      do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
      page.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
      inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer
      of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used
      to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element,
      together with JavaScript.
